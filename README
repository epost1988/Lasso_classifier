Current issues: unable to upload the counttable csv files required to run the dataset. Datafiles can be downloaded from my google drive:

Required to download from google drive:   htseq_counts.csv -> csv containing htseq count output data
                                          fusion_htseq_combined_counts.csv -> count table containing the entire findings of both fusion genes and htseq count genes.
                                          sampleinfo.csv -> contains sample class information.
                                          
When running the code, I would recommend running the benchmark pipeline, as it's the faster of the two. The LOOCVs in the Lasso regression pipeline are very time consuming (up to an hour per LOOCV).
